Runtime Development Exercises
===================

1. Remove the sudo pallet, and then perform a runtime upgrade to your new sudo-less runtime.

2. Starting from the result of exercise #1, could you perform another runtime upgrade? If so, try it. If not, explain why not.

3. Substrate offers more elaborate governance mechanisms than just the sudo pallet. Install the Democracy pallet in your runtime, start a clean chain
