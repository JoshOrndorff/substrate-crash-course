Full and Light Nodes
====================

Our network in the previous unit was not very decentralized. There was only a single node. If that node went offline, or turned malicious, not only would we be unable to continue using the blockchain, but we would have lost all of our data. We can make our network more resiliant by having multiple nodes hosting the data.

Add a full node

Add a light node

What's the difference

If our first node goes offline, do we still have the blockchain data? Can we still use the network?
