Multiple Validators
===================
In unit one we started a simple centralized blockchain network. In the last section we took a step toward decentralization by adding more nodes that track the state of the blockchain. That prevented catastrophic data loss, but it did not enable us to continue using the network if our first node went down. In this section we'll address that. Kill all the nodes; we're starting fresh.

Run chain local with Alice and bob as validators.
