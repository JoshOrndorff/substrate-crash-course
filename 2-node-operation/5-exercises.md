Node Operation Exercises
========================
1. Complete the private Network tutorial
2. Start a network with 3 validators and 2 full nodes.
3. Considering the network in step 2, how many nodes (and which nodes) can be killed while without the network stopping?
4. Advanced: Considering the network in step two, how many nodes (and which nodes) can be killed without stopping finality. (You learned the skills to perform this experiment in the course, but you did not learn the theory behind finalization. For that theory, check out [link to grandpa paper])
