# Substrate Crash Course

This Crash Course is designed to teach the most useful aspects of developing with Substrate, Parity's framework for rapid blockchain development. It presents the material in a structured manner to get developers productive quickly and to avoid the cost of searching all documentation and tutorials before beginning to code. It references existing documentation and tutorials along the way. This course is not designed to teach everything there is to know about Substrate, but to get developers to a point where they can navigate the more detailed documentation on their own.

## Target Personas

Anyone is welcome to use this material to learn about the Substrate blockchain framework, but some prerequisite knowledge is required. If you identify as one of these personas, this course has something to offer you. If you identify as two or more personas, you will likely be successful in completing the course. The bullets under each persona give you an idea of whether you may identify as that persona. You need not satisfy every bullet point to identify with a persona.

### Blockchain Enthusiast
* I've run a bitcoin or ethereum node
* I understand the idea of a hash-linked list (or other data-structure)
* I've used a cryptocurrency or smart contract
* I have metamask installed on my browser

### Rust Developer
* I know how to use structs, enums, and traits in rust.
* I understand ownership and borrowing, and how they avoid memory unsafety
* I contributed to a moderately complex rust project (beyond hello world)
* I've completed the rust in motion course
* I've completed the first ten chapters of the rust book

### Javascript Developer
* I use yarn or npm often
* I've developed react applications'
* I understand closures in javascript
* I have opinions about flow, typescript, and dynamic typing

## What You Will Learn

You will learn
* to operate Substrate nodes
* to interact with a Substrate based blockchain
* to write a blockchain runtime that supports your dApp's on-chain logic

You will not learn advanced features of Substrate, but don't worry, there are plenty more resources available for that. In particular this course will not cover:
* Custom Consensus engines
* Coordination between runtime and client
* Custom RPCs
* Smart Contracts or ink!

Many learners will want to complete the course, but it is also possible to learn a subset of the knowledge that is particularly relevant to your goals as a Substrate developer.

## What You Should Know Already

This course assumes that you are familiar with some standard development tools.
* A shell or command line
* A text editor or IDE
* Compiling and executing software
* Some basic blockchain principles
